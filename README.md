Accompanying code for master's thesis "The Impact of Differential Privacy on Minority Population Data" 

The dependencies needed for executing the code can be installed using the pipfile in the folder `experiments`. 

Due to the large file size of the files in `census_data\`, several folders have been compressed and have to be extracted before running the code.
