Accompanying code for master's thesis "The Impact of Differential Privacy on Minority Population Data" 

The dependencies needed for executing the code can be installed using the pipfile in the folder `experiments`. 

Due to the large file size of the csv files in `bulk_data\csv_files`, the folder `datasets_dp_full` has been compressed and has to be extracted before running the code.
